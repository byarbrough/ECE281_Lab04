###ALU Preliminary Simulation
These simulation results show that the ALU works. This is evident by looking at the value of _Result_ and comparing it to the expected value from the inputs in the testbench. There was no issue getting this part of the program to work; it was simply a case statement within the predefined process. The trigger and the different states were already defines, so there was not even a need to make a new type.

The results of this simulation are below.

The process of ensuring that this simulation meets expectations is rather redundant, and not exactly fun. For each differnt test, every 20 ms, I had to go through and manually make sure that the result is correct. The table below contains a partial list of some of the tests.
